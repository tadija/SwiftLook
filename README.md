## How it's made

- start Xcode / New Project / iOS / [Document Based App](https://developer.apple.com/document-based-apps)
- add [Splash](http://github.com/JohnSundell/Splash) package made by [@JohnSundell](http://twitter.com/JohnSundell)
- connect those two together and voila: you have a nice reading app :)
